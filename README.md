# binclude
binclude converts binary files to C/C++ arrays

the program can be built simply with..

    gcc binclude.c -o binclude
    
for usage, run without any arguments..

    ./binclude 

    binclude converts binary files to C/C++ arrays
        usage:  binclude [filename] [array name] [optional column width] > target.c

then run binclude with any binary file you need as data in your C/C++ program, optionaly with the column width. This defaults to 8.

    ./binclude monty.prg monty 4
    
This will output to stdout..

    const unsigned char monty[] = {
        0x00,0x80,0x00,0x70,
        0x00,0x70,0x00,0xc2,
        0xcd,0x38,0x30,0x4c,
        0x89,0x00,0x00,0x00,
        0x00,0x00,0x00,0x00,
        0xa9,0x0f,0x8d,0x18,
        0xd4,0xee,0xfa,0x84,
        0x2c,0xee,0x84,0x30,
        0x1e,0x50,0x31,0xa9,
        0x00,0x8d,0xfa,0x84,
        0xa2,0x02,0x9d,0xc4,
        0x84,0x9d,0xc7,0x84,
        0x00,0x00,0x00,0x00,
        0x00,0x00
    };

To write this to a file....

    ./binclude monty.prg monty 4 >monty.c

Aaaand we're done.
